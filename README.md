# README

LuminousScript is a single page web application that allows you to display, add, and delete a collection of photos. It’s essentially a virtual photograph collection that you can share with anyone. 

Create your Luminous post now: -Run 'bundle install’ in terminal to download the gems needed to run the application. You will need two servers running to access this application.
Backend: 
-Open a new terminal and change directory to the Backend by typing ‘cd backend’
-Open the server by typing 'rails s' in the terminal. -Open the web browser and type in http://localhost:3000  and the web application will load.


Frontend:
-Open a second terminal and change directory to the frontend by typing ‘cd frontend’ 
-For windows users type, ‘explorer.exe index.html’ -For mac users type, ‘open index.html’
This will open a window to the Luminous Script Application. You are now ready to start your collection!
